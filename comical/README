------------------------------------------------
Comical - The Comic Book Archive reader for *nix
------------------------------------------------

Finally - native CBR and CBZ support on your favorite Unix!  Read your favorite
scanned comic books and graphic novels with Comical's absurdly easy GUI and
in-your-face double page display!

Nifty Features:
Several zoom modes - 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, Fit, Fit-to-Width, and Fit-to-Height.
Crisp image scaling with algorithms adapted from FreeImage 3.
Autodetects double pages scanned together and displays it accordingly.
Full-Screen mode (not on MacOS X).
Single-Page or Double-Page display modes.
Displays JPG, GIF, PNG, and TIFF images.
Supports RAR(.cbr) and ZIP(.cbz) comic book archives

Rationale:
Comical came to be because I felt somehow dirty using CDisplay through Wine,
and I really wanted to share the fun of CBRs with a Mac-using friend of mine.
The demand for both a Linux and a Mac OS X version of CDisplay on the Mutant
Liberation Front Forums also spurred me on.

Requirements:
It should be possible to build Comical on any platform which supports
wxWidgets 2.4.2 with zlib support
and a recent ISO/C98 compliant C++ compiler, like gcc 3.x.
