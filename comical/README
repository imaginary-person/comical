Comical - The Comic Book Archive reader for *nix
------------------------------------------------

Finally - native CBR and CBZ support on your favorite Unix!  Read your favorite
scanned comic books and graphic novels with Comical's absurdly easy GUI and
in-your-face double page display!

Nifty Features:
Supports five zoom modes - 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and Fit.
Zooming uses Lanczos 3 algorithm, adopted from FreeImage 3.
Autodetects double pages scanned together and displays it accordingly.
Full-Screen mode (not working on MacOS X).
Supports JPG, GIF, PNG, and TIFF images.
Supports RAR(.cbr), ZIP(.cbz), and bzip2'ed tar(.cbb) archives

About:
This program is the result of me, the author, scratching my own itch.  I felt
somehow dirty using CDisplay through Wine, and I really wanted to share the fun
of CBRs with a Mac-using friend of mine.  The demand for both a Linux and a Mac
OS X version of CDisplay on the Mutant Liberation Front Forums also spurred me
on.
This program uses command-line decompressors because it's the only way to open
RARs later than version 2.0 on Unix.  I would use unrarlib, but the unrarlib
team has no plans to support anything later than 2.0, ever.  Besides, connecting
small programs with pipes to create larger applications is the Unix Way^TM. :-)

Requirements:
It should be possible to build Comical on any platform which supports
wxWindows 2.4.x,
unrar 3.20 or later,
unzip 5.50 or later,
and a recent ISO/C98 compliant C++ compiler, like gcc 3.

Thanks:
- wxWindows (http://www.wxwindows.org) is robust and featureful.  Many thanks
to the wxWindows team.
- pStreams (http://pstreams.sourceforge.net/) made this program possible, since
I'm too lazy to do that nasty fork()/execvp() stuff myself.
- I'm using image resizing from FreeImage (http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/).
Thanks for GPLing your work so I could use it!
